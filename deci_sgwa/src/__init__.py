# This file makes the 'app' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty or used for package-level initializations if necessary.
# For most FastAPI applications, it can remain empty.

# Example: If you had a global logger setup or some other app-wide context
# from .core.logging_config import setup_logging
# setup_logging()
